# This is a template YML file used to specify the inputs for a BD Genomics Rhaposdy Analysis pipeline run. See the
# BD Genomics Analysis Setup User Guide (Doc ID: 47383) for more details. Enter the following information:


## Reads (required) - Path to your read files in the FASTQ.GZ format. You may specify as many R1/R2 read pairs as you want.
Reads:

 - class: File
   location: "test/mySample_R1_.fastq.gz"

 - class: File
   location: "test/mySample_R2_.fastq.gz"


## Reference (required) - Path to mRNA reference file for pre-designed, supplemental, or custom panel, in FASTA format.
Reference:
 - class: File
   location: "test/reference.fasta"

## AbSeq_Reference (optional) - Path to the AbSeq reference file in FASTA format.  Only needed if BD AbSeq Ab-Oligos are used.
#AbSeq_Reference:
# - class: File
#   location: "test/AbSeq_reference.fasta"

## Bam_input (optional) - Path to the BAM output from a previous analysis of the same library as the FASTQ files.
Bam_Input:
 - class: File
   location: "test/mySample.final.BAM"


## Subsample (optional) - A number >1 or fraction (0 < n < 1) to indicate the number or percentage of reads to subsample.
#Subsample: 0.01

## Subsample seed (optional) - A seed for replicating a previous subsampled run.
#Subsample_seed: 3445

## Sample Tags Version (optional) - Specify if multiplexed run: human, hs, mouse or mm
#Sample_Tags_Version: human

## Subsample Sample Tags (optional) -  A number >1 or fraction (0 < n < 1) to indicate the number or percentage of reads to subsample.
#Subsample_Tags: 0.05

## Tag_Names (optional) - Specify the tag number followed by '-' and the desired sample name to appear in Sample_Tag_Metrics.csv
# Do not use the special characters: &, (), [], {},  <>, ?, |
#Tag_Names: [4-mySample, 9-myOtherSample, 6-alsoThisSample]
