 - class: File
   location: "test/mySample_R1_.fastq.gz"


## Reference (required) - path to the gene panel used to prepare the library, in FASTA format.
Reference:
 - class: File
   location: "test/Immune_Response_Panel_Hs.fasta"


## Bam_input (optional) - Path to the BAM output from a previous analysis of the same library as the FASTQ files.

## Subsample (optional) - A number >1 or fraction (0 < n < 1) to indicate the number or percentage of reads to subsample.
#Subsample: 0.01

## Subsample seed (optional) - A seed for replicating a previous subsampled run.
#Subsample_seed: 3445
