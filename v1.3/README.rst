Customer Facing CWL and YML files
===========================================

Updated: 8/16/17

Description
-----------

These are the customer facing versios of the CWL/YML files. They are delivered to customers via a public bitbucket
repo (pending BDG website) located at: https://bitbucket.org/CRSwDev/cwl


Differences with internal CWLs
------------------------------

We need this external version for the following reasons:

 - CWL needs to point to Rhapsody, not MIST
 - Remove intermediate outputs that are not customer facing
 - Remove input settings not availble to customers
 - Provide a YML template that is easy to use
